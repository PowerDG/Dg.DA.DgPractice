## Project and Product names using "Spark"

Organizations creating products and projects for use with Apache Spark, along with associated  marketing materials, should take care to respect the trademark in “Apache Spark” and its logo.  Please refer to [ASF Trademarks Guidance](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) and  associated [FAQ](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/)  for comprehensive and authoritative guidance on proper usage of ASF trademarks.

Names that do not include “Spark” at all have no potential trademark issue with the Spark project.  This is recommended.

Names like “Spark BigCoProduct” are not OK, as are names including “Spark” in general.  The above links, however, describe some exceptions, like for names such as “BigCoProduct,  powered by Apache Spark” or “BigCoProduct for Apache Spark”.

It is common practice to create software identifiers (Maven coordinates, module names, etc.)  like “spark-foo”. These are permitted. Nominative use of trademarks in descriptions is also  always allowed, as in “BigCoProduct is a widget for Apache Spark”.

## Companies and Organizations
